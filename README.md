BeAcross is an Across initiative platform providing you a variety of modules from different European **across border universities**. This project is under Technische Universität Chemnitz contributed by Victory Pie Solutions.


## About Across
Across conducts an initiative led by Technische Universität Chemnitz known as the **Across Alliance**. This alliance consists of ten European universities that collectively form the European cross border University [Across](https://www.across-alliance.eu/) . 


## Across Aims
The goal is to facilitate successful cross-border exchange and collaboration within different regions in Europe. The initiative seeks to deepen cooperation among European universities situated across borders. The focus of this cooperation will be on crucial cross-border issues such as development and economic challenges, comparative law and public administration, education, natural resource management, tourism, migrations transportation, culture, and the preservation of cross-border cultural heritage.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
To start Across web application, you have to start 2 services - Backend and Across. You have to set up your environment beforehand. Please follow these steps.
1. Setup your development environment for backend web services according to the [Backend README](/_backend/README.md)
2. Setup your development environment for Across website according to the [Across README](/across-app/README.md)

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
